### Research & Documention

- Setup
    - You get the api token from the bot page on the discord developer portal
    - This API token needs to be put in a .env file
    - For this code to run, you need the Discord.py and the dotenv libraries
- Usage
    - `with your changes to the code in place, describe`
    - `what commands you can type in your Discord server`
    - `what response this will provide (from your bot)`
- Research
    - `you may have realized that it is lame that it only runs when you run the program.`
    - `In the real world, things are "always on", not waiting for Bob to turn his PC on and make sure the program is running.`
    - `Research some possible solutions that would solve this, and discuss why you think it would work.`
