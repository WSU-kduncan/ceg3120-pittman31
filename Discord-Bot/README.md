### Research & Documention

- Setup
    - You get the api token from the bot page on the discord developer portal
    - This API token needs to be put in a .env file
    - For this code to run, you need the Discord.py and the dotenv libraries
- Usage
    - I added the functionality to roll a d20
    - "!rd20"
    - The bot will respond with a random number between 1 and 20
- Research
    - Cloud Hosting is a possible solution
    - This would work because the bot needs a terminal and a computer to run the python code. Renting a computer on the cloud to always be on would allow the bot to be on 24/7.
